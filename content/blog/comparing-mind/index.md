description: Why do we compare ourselves to others?
---

We are hardwired to compare ourselves to others.

Why? Because it kept us alive. Now it's killing us.

Imagine you are someone in your tribe that has no urge to climb the social ladder. You likely stare off into the long sunsets, you smile at your friend's triumphs, you feel no angst when your friend gets the girl, even though he may have put you down in the process.

You smile, you are content.

##Where the sages at yo?
The thing about nature, it doesn't seem to reward those that were content. It paid a hefty subsidy to those that pushed and strived and got the food, the girls, the houses.

All the happy-go-lucky, underachievers died out over time. We are descendants of the high-achievers. The people that were assholes let's be honest. The one's that made sure they ate, even if that meant cuttin' some fools.

Looking at evolutionary psychology, we find that social comparison lights up the [reward centers.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4222713/)

When they play their thought games with people under an fMRI scanner, they see people feel good when subjects think they earned more money, were more proficient at some task, or anything else that demonstrated superiority.

We feel pain when we compare ourselves and feel inferior. Low-level code strikes again. This pain is signaling that we may be cast out of the clan if we descend too low in the hierarchy, we may not eat if things get tough or get eaten.

Do we wonder why we would feel pain? It's something that served us well for thousands of years, just like the pain of our empty stomachs, or the cold on our skins. It was a life-saving signal that we needed to move our asses.

##Our reward system is like Windows 95©
Imagine if we had no pleasure during eating. The result, no one would be overweight, not by a single gram. Eating would be like shitting or flossing; it's something you must do, and your parents make an effort for you to do it, and it's rarely enjoyable.

Imagine if sex was not pleasurable. It would be something we deal with similarly to how we deal with homelessness, starving children, or fracking; it's something that takes courage, determination, and a lot of willpower.

Our society is a reflection of the hardwired reward systems from the ancient past. Our capacity for pain and suffering and our capacity for pleasure and ecstasy shape everything we do. Only the fringes over the ages question the motives and ask if there is another way forward.

##Hedonic treadmill
Heiron, cocaine (hell of a drug), meth, caffeine, alcohol, sex, porn, Netflix (yeah it makes the list) - trouble is you just always need more. No good ending to these stories. The reality is anything that stimulates our pleasure system carries the same risk.

If cocaine were scarce, and you could only get it for one week out of the year. It grew on some hard to cultivate tree, and there was no way to preserve it, we would all be coke heads, every one of us because we would never learn about the long term consequences, we would never have coke heads in society. We would have coke enthusiasts like we have storm chasers.

Nature, in this scenario, is our natural limiter. Everything we now have trouble with, as a society, was once limited in nature—food, sex, drugs. We were just fine having some of the most intense pleasure drivers to make sure we took action when opportunities presented themselves. We weren't fuckin around.

##The tugging circle
The unfortunate reality is that we are all on a ship heading for a not so great ending. Spoiler, everyone in this film dies. The trouble is, we all know this, but we kind of dodge it in our youth, companies then sell us a dream and distraction as we grow, they are also being distracted by others' distractions and so goes the circle jerk of delusion.

In our youth, we think that death thing is not going to happen to us. In our **_20s_**, we might feel the world is our oyster, and we are immortal. "Hey, they might even solve this death thing in my lifetime."

In our **_30s_**, we may have worked hard and created better surroundings, but now that scary future starts to tap the window, "tick tick tick mother fucker, I see you in there." says that cloaked vigilante with a grin.

##Along comes pleasure!
![Pleasure](https://media.giphy.com/media/LwjQ4GrYDudcA/source.gif)

**_Oh god, it's good._**

1. Netflix - marathon time, veg, and eat.
2. Throw in lots of porn.
3. Add drugs to the mix.
4. Caffeine.
5. Sugar.
6. Oh yeah, social media.

We get to trigger our social hierarchy reward system on-demand now. We feel the pain of seeing someone else lounging in the tropics with their ripped body, just knowing they are getting laid tonight, and then we are driven to enter the arena with our content.

All of this sweeps away the nasty bits for a time.

**Let's do it already** - Rename the submit button to the "I'm better than you." button.

At some point, we hit a moment in our lives when we wonder if we are on a winning path. Will more stuff, more status, more of the pleasure trap get us to the promised land?

At this juncture, people either double down or look for something new.

##Rewire your nonsense
You can't trust your instincts anymore. Your instinct is to eat Krispy Kream. How can you trust something that tells you that's a good idea? Your instinct helps you survive on an alien planet, a planet with more in common with pluto than our own.

If you listen to that system, it will fuck you. All the motivational speakers of the times, all the religions, the philosophies, psychological techniques, witch doctors, and shamans all share a simple unifying idea - you need to do something other than your natural response. You wouldn't be listening to them otherwise. You would have already done it.

##The way out
A great woman once said, know thy system. We must learn how this thing upstairs works.

More to come...
